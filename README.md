# 🎲 Dice Simulator (GUI – Python)

## 📌 Introduction
The **Dice Simulator (GUI)** is a desktop-based application developed using **Python and Tkinter**.  
It simulates the behavior of a real six-sided dice by generating a random number between **1 and 6** every time the user clicks a button.

Unlike command-line programs, this application runs in a **separate graphical window**, providing a real software-like experience.  
The project is designed especially for **beginners** to understand the basics of **GUI programming, random number generation, and event handling** in Python.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To simulate a real dice using a computer program
- To introduce beginners to GUI-based application development
- To demonstrate the use of random numbers in Python
- To build a simple yet interactive desktop application

---

## ✨ Features Explained

### 🖥 Graphical User Interface
The application uses **Tkinter**, Python’s standard GUI library, to create a clean and simple desktop window.  
Users interact with the program through buttons instead of typing commands in the terminal.

### 🎲 Dice Roll Simulation
With a single click on the **“Roll Dice”** button:
- The program generates a random number between **1 and 6**
- This number represents the face of a standard dice
- The result is displayed instantly on the screen

### ⚡ Instant Output
The dice value appears immediately after clicking the button, making the application fast and responsive.

### 🎯 Beginner Friendly
The interface is minimal and easy to understand, making it suitable for users with no prior programming experience.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

### 🐍 Python
Python is used as the core programming language due to its simplicity and readability.

### 🖼 Tkinter
Tkinter is used to create the graphical user interface.  
It allows the application to run as a **desktop window** instead of a terminal-based program.

### 🎲 Random Module
The `random` module is used to generate random dice values between 1 and 6.

## ▶ How to Run the Application

### Step 1: Install Python
Ensure that **Python 3** is installed on your system.

You can verify this by running:
```bash
python --version
